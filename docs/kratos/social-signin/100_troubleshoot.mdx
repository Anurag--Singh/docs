### `redirect_uri` mismatch

Ensure that the `redirect_uri` query parameter in the URL matches the authorized redirect URI added to the social provider.

```
https://<provider>/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=(...)&
redirect_uri=https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider>&
response_type=code&scope=email+profile+openid
```

### Domain `oryapis.com` requires verification

Integrating with a social provider may require you to prove your ownership of the authorized redirect URI domain. In this case,
the `https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com` URL cannot be used as the redirect URI and only a custom domain can be used.

To configure Ory to add your domain to the `redirect_uri` query parameter when redirecting to the social provider, you need to
adjust your project OIDC `base_redirect_uri` configuration.

```shell
ory patch identity-config <project-id> --add '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri="https://my-custom-domain.com"'
```

Lastly, ensure that the custom domain is added to the social provider as an authorized redirect URI.
